This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an incorrectly implemented useEffect hook. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version. The issue arises when a state variable is modified within a useEffect hook, and that same variable is included in the hook's dependency array. This creates a cycle where the state update triggers a re-render, which in turn triggers the useEffect hook again, leading to an infinite loop. The solution involves carefully managing the useEffect hook's dependencies and ensuring the correct updating of state.
